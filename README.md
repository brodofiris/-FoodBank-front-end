# -FoodBank-front-end
FoodBank project made with Expo. The main goal of the project is to reduce food waste level.

<p>In today's world, many problems can be solved using technology. In the case of food waste, the use of a mobile application contributes to solving a global problem through a reward system and easy accessibility.<p>

<p>From an ethical point of view, food waste has a direct impact on society. While we are throwing away food, many people around the world have limited access to food. Meanwhile, population growth means higher consumption and more demand for processed foods.</p>
